ConsenSys Course Final Project Brainstorming

For my final project I would like to create a DAO.

Some ideas I have for my DOA:

A voting system where participants can vote on the emission schedules of tokens/coins I tie to the DAO.

A community run incentive program with checks and balances for high-quantity token holders (51% attack)

Build out a successful emissions schedule/token
