Function sketches (I changed up final project to reflect site I've been working on for client, at https://onepixel.app)

function pixelHolder(address holder) {
  finds out if they own a pixel
}

function claimPass(address holder) isHolder(holder) {
  claim pixel pass token into your wallet
}

function mintPass(uint PassId, address holder) ownsPass(holder) {
  mint the claimed pass
}
